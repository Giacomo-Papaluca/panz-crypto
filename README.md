#pcrypto

pcrypto is a collection of cryptographic algorithms and attacks created during my Cryptography classes. The algorithms' implementation are simple and easy to modify so that they can be used for educational purposes.

Please note that any of these implementations are cryptographically secure. They shouldn't be used in any context that require a cryptographically secure implementation.
